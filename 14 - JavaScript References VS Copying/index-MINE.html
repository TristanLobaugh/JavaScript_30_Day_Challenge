    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // let age = 100;
    // let age2 =  age;
    // console.log(age, age2);
    // age = 200;
    // console.log(age, age2);

    // let name = 'Wes';
    // let name2 = name;
    // console.log(name, name2);
    // name = 'wesley';
    // console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players, team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[3] = 'Chewie';
    console.log(players, team2);

    // one day


    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

//2nd BEST WAY - or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = "Tristan";
    console.log(players, team4);
//OR probably best way
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = "Josh";
    console.log(players, team5);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
        name: 'Wes Bos',
        age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const person2 = person;
    person2.age = 99;
    console.log(person, person2);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person3 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 70});
    console.log(person, person3);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    //const person4 = {...person};
    //console.log(person, person4);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
        name: 'Wes',
        age: 100,
        social: {
            twitter: '@wesbos',
            facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
        }
    };

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);

    //worst case use - poor mans deep clone
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));

    console.log(dev);
